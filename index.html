AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle inducted into the RCB Hall of Fame
An evening that began with the Director of Cricket operations for RCB, Mike Hesson announcing that two special members of the RCB family were going to get inducted into the hall of fame and ended with the beloved duo making a virtual appearance, had everything from a hit of nostalgia to emotions running high in the RCB camp. A video montage rushed everyone back in time as the best moments from the careers of the two RCB legends played in the team room.  AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle are the first two inductees into the RCB Hall of Fame.


It was another RCB legend himself Virat Kohli who would announce the inductions of his two dear mates over the years to loud cheers that reverberated around the RCB team room. “AB has truly changed the game of cricket with his innovation, brilliance, and sportsmanship which truly defines the RCB Play Bold philosophy,” said Virat Kohli. “It’s truly special for me to be doing this for both of you. We saw videos of how you have changed the way the IPL has been played over the years. Two people who have had a huge impact in IPL being where it is today; and RCB being where it is today,” he added.


AB de Villiers who had joined the induction virtually then had an emotional message to everyone in the RCB camp. “To the RCB boys sitting there, what an amazing privilege. Quite emotional to be honest,” he said. “Virat, thanks for the kind words. Mike, Nikhil, everyone from the franchise who set this up, it’s a really special touch. We had some amazing times together as a team, and the sun has moved on for Chris and I now, but we’re still very much part of the family and will always be. So yes, thank you very much for the very special touch. Faf and the guys sitting there, Virat and the guys that know me really well for many years know how special stuff like this is to me. You guys know how much of an amazing journey I had during the IPL, especially with my RCB family, and how it changed my life. So, huge privilege to be part of this.

AB mentioned it’s gonna be emotional as well because it’s very touching for such a franchise has created over the years, it’s really, really fantastic. And to Virat, thank you for the kind words as well, fantastic sharing the dressing room with you guys as well,” he concluded as he wished the team the best for the rest of the season. 


At the end of the entire ceremony, there was still a bit of surprise left as it was announced that a plan to present the two momentos to the two legends next year at the Chinnaswamy stadium in a city that has now become their home was in the works.

<h1>   A SUCCESSFULL FAMILY MAN    </h1>
<img src="v5.jpg" class="center" width="100" height="300"></img >
<P1>
  Upon arrival, Virat Kohli was spotted by the ever-present paparazzi, who captured moments of him with his family, showcasing a softer side of the cricketing icon. These images quickly circulated across social media platforms, much to the delight of fans who admire not just Kohli the cricketer but Kohli the family man.
  It was 2015. India had lost the semi-final match against Australia in the Cricket World Cup and Virat Kohli, who carried the collective weight of expectations of 1.4 billion people, gave a poor performance. Something unexpected happened next. The suspicions and accusations were turned to Anushka Sharma, who was there to show support, amongst a crowd of thousands.

Twitter (Now X) and Facebook were flooded with hate comments, blaming Virat’s girlfriend Anushka for distracting him. Ever since it became netizens’ favourite thing to do, and it happened again recently when India lost the ICC World Test Championship 2023 Final against Australia and Anushka was blamed for it. “She’s bad luck for Indian cricket,” says an X user. It didn’t matter how baseless and ridiculous the accusations were. What did Virat Kohli do through it all?

His response has been an unflinching support for Anushka, an unabashed display of affection for his wife, and a constant attribution of his success to her.
“Anushka always told me that if you stand by the truth, you don't have to worry about anything because the path will carve itself out, and things will always be clear and distinct.” After India’s big win at the T20 World Cup, Virat shared a heart-touching Insta post for his wife. “None of this would remotely be possible without you my love. You keep me humble, grounded and you always say it how it is with absolute honesty. I couldn't be more grateful for you. This victory is as much yours as it's mine. Thank you and I love you for being YOU.”
Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s Tuscany wedding was nothing short of a dream. By then, they’d braved countless trolls and even a breakup. The relationship has seen many seasons, as many as Virat’s facial hair, who’s currently rocking a woodsman's beard. There is evolution, there are learnings, a lot of which Virat attributes to his wife. He also declared himself a feminist and shared during an interview with LiveMint: “People are very chauvinistic in this country. I certainly wasn’t aware of that growing up, to be honest. But I have started to see myself as a feminist.”
</P1>
<h3>MODERN DAD</h3>
<P1>
  The two share two children – Vaamika, born in 2021 and Akaay, born in February, this year. Parenting is not an easy job but the two are not adhering to traditional gendered roles when raising their kids. They share responsibilities and follow equality.
  “We do not see it as mum and dad duties, but as a family unit. For us, it is important that our child be raised with a very balanced outlook. In Virat's case, he plays around the year. What becomes important is the time we spend together as a family,” she said in an interview.

Virat had opened up a pandora’s box when he applied for paternity leave to be with wife Anushka during the birth of their first child. Critics saw it as a ‘dereliction of national duties’ but his reasons were simple. “I wanted to be back home in time to be with my wife for the birth of my first child. It is a very, very special and very, very beautiful moment that I want to experience,” he had said, paving the path for dads-to-be who wouldn’t take it as a sign of weakness. In a country where a father’s role in parenting is often negated, this was a welcome step.

We all know what Virat Kohli is capable of. His influence is not restricted by the boundaries on a cricket pitch. The way he’s been using it to show love and respect for relationships and promote equality, makes him a true icon. We hail!
